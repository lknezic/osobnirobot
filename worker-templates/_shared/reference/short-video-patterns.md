## THE 3-SECOND RULE

**CRITICAL:** All short-form platforms decide fate in 3 seconds. Your hook IS the content.

### DATA HOOKS (First 3 Seconds):
- "Made [$ Amount] in [N] days"
- "Lost [$ Amount] on this one"
- "[Win rate]% success over [N] attempts"
- "[$ Amount] in [N] months [doing X]"

### PROBLEM HOOKS (First 3 Seconds):
- "Stop [doing common thing]"
- "This mistake cost me [$ Amount]"
- "[Bad thing happened], here's what I did"
- "[Metric] down [N]%, don't panic"

### PATTERN HOOKS (First 3 Seconds):
- "I did this for [N] months before..."
- "Everyone does [X], I do [Y]"
- "This changed my [approach]"
- "One rule I never break"

### QUESTION HOOKS (First 3 Seconds):
- "[Option A] or [Option B]?"
- "What's your [setting/target]?"
- "Ever [lost track / messed up / missed] [something]?"

### STORY HOOKS (First 3 Seconds):
- "Last week I [did X]. Worst decision."
- "My [client/boss/audience] asked me to [task]. Here's what happened."
- "Day 1 vs Day 30 of [approach]:"

### CONTRARIAN HOOKS (First 3 Seconds):
- "[Popular advice] is wrong. Here's proof."
- "Everyone's doing [X]. I stopped. Results improved."
- "Unpopular opinion: [bold claim]"

**Universal Pattern:** [Attention-grabber] + [Promise of value]

Always: Hook → Value → CTA in under 60 sec

## INSTAGRAM-SPECIFIC: CAPTIONS

### Caption Guidelines:
- **Length:** 100-200 words
- **Hashtags:** 5-8 relevant
- **Structure:** Hook → Details → Lesson → Question → Hashtags
- **Always end with engagement question:** "Comment below 👇"

### Caption Template:
```
[Hook line with emoji] ✅

[Details - 2-3 lines of specifics]

[Why / reasoning - 2-3 lines]

[Result / data point]

[Engagement question] 👇

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3 #hashtag4 #hashtag5
```

## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC VOICE

### TikTok Voice:
- **Ultra-fast:** No time for fluff
- **Visual:** Text overlays, screenshots
- **Value-first:** Immediate insight
- **Authentic > polished:** Real, not produced
- **Anti-guru:** Humble, peer

### Instagram Voice:
- **Visual-first:** Let data/images speak
- **Clean design:** Professional not corporate
- **Quick value:** Fast insights
- **Personality:** Show behind-the-scenes
- **Hashtag strategic:** 5-8 relevant

### YouTube Shorts Voice:
- Same as TikTok but slightly more polished
- Can reference longer videos for depth
- "Link in bio for full video" works

---

## WHAT WORKS ON SHORT-FORM

✅ Quick results with numbers
✅ Fast tips (one rule, one method)
✅ Mistakes and lessons learned
✅ Data comparisons (A vs B)
✅ Behind-the-scenes

## WHAT DOESN'T WORK

❌ Complex explanations (save for long-form)
❌ Long strategies (too much for 60 sec)
❌ Detailed demos (too long)
❌ Theoretical concepts (need visuals)
❌ Multiple topics (one point only)

---

## PRODUCTION TIPS

### Text Overlays:
- Essential on all platforms
- Readable at mobile size
- 3-5 words per overlay
- High contrast against background

### Pacing:
- New visual every 2-3 seconds
- Cut dead air ruthlessly
- Move fast — the viewer will rewatch if interested

### Audio:
- Trending sounds boost discovery (TikTok, Reels)
- Voiceover works on all platforms
- Music optional but helps retention

### Visual Priority:
Instagram > TikTok > YouTube Shorts (visual expectations)

## INSTAGRAM-SPECIFIC: CAROUSEL & STATIC POSTS

Carousels consistently get the highest engagement on Instagram (even above Reels for educational content).

### Carousel Structure (5-10 slides):

```
Slide 1: HOOK — Bold text, curiosity or data point
         (This is the "thumbnail" — must stop the scroll)
Slide 2: CONTEXT — Set up the problem or topic
Slide 3-8: VALUE — One point per slide, clean design
         (Use large text, minimal words, high contrast)
Slide 9: SUMMARY — Recap key points
Slide 10: CTA — "Save this", "Share with someone who needs it", "Follow for more"
```

### Carousel Design Rules:
- **Text per slide:** 15-30 words maximum
- **Font size:** Large enough to read without zooming
- **Color:** Consistent brand palette across slides
- **Last slide:** Always include a CTA
- **Arrow/indicator:** Show viewers to keep swiping ("→" or "Swipe →" on early slides)

### Carousel Topics That Work:
- "[N] things about [topic]" — listicle format
- "Beginner vs Pro" comparisons
- Step-by-step tutorials (1 step per slide)
- Myth vs Reality
- Before/After transformations
- Data breakdowns with charts

### Static Post Guidelines:
- **Image posts:** High-quality, relevant visual
- **Quote posts:** Clean design, bold text, brand colors
- **Infographic:** One concept, visually explained
- **Behind-the-scenes:** Authentic, not staged
- Caption is critical — see caption template above

## CONTENT REPURPOSING GUIDE

One piece of content → multiple platforms. Work smarter.

### Long-form → Short-form Pipeline:
```
YouTube Long Video (10-15 min)
  ├── YouTube Short (best 30-sec moment)
  ├── TikTok (re-edit for TikTok voice/pacing)
  ├── Instagram Reel (same as TikTok, add caption)
  ├── Instagram Carousel (key points as slides)
  ├── X/Twitter Thread (script adapted to tweet format)
  └── Email Newsletter (video recap + link)
```

### Short-form → Other Formats:
```
TikTok/Reel that performs well
  ├── Expand into YouTube long-form video
  ├── Turn into X/Twitter thread with more detail
  ├── Write blog post / article version
  └── Create Instagram carousel with the data
```

### Repurposing Rules:
- **Adapt, don't copy-paste.** Each platform has its own voice and format.
- **Best-performing content** should be repurposed first (proven concept).
- **Timing:** Stagger across platforms (don't post everywhere at once).
- **Track which platform version performs best** — that tells you where your audience lives.

### What to Repurpose (Priority):
1. Content that got high engagement on any platform
2. Educational content (works everywhere)
3. Results/data content (universal appeal)
4. Mistakes/lessons learned (relatable across platforms)
