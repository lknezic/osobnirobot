# X/TWITTER: THREADS — UNIVERSAL PLAYBOOK
## Agent Reference for Any Niche

**Purpose:** 5 thread frameworks that work in any niche. Adapt using client context. Read 01-copywriting-principles.md first.

---

## WHY THREADS WIN

Hard data:
- **3x more engagement** than single tweets
- Each tweet = separate engagement opportunity (algorithm counts each)
- **Threads using "I" get 23% more engagement** than third-person
- **Visual breaks every 3-4 tweets** increase completion rate by **45%**
- Highly bookmarkable (saves = strongest quality signal)
- **7 tweets is the sweet spot** — most viral threads are 5-10 tweets

### Thread Engagement Cascade
The algorithm tests tweet 1 on a small group. If they engage, it shows the thread to a larger pool. If THAT pool engages, it goes to For You. Tweet 1 is the gate — if it fails, the whole thread dies regardless of how good tweets 2-10 are.

---

## UNIVERSAL THREAD RULES

### Structure
- Number every tweet: "1/10, 2/10..."
- **Sweet spot: 6-10 tweets.** Under 5 feels thin. Over 12 loses most readers.
- 1-2 ideas per tweet maximum
- Each tweet must work standalone (some readers see individual tweets in feed)

### Visual Strategy (45% Higher Completion)
- **Image on Tweet 1** = 2x algorithm boost (non-negotiable)
- **Image/chart every 3-4 tweets** = visual breaks prevent drop-off
- Screenshots, data visualizations, before/after > stock photos
- P&L, dashboards, analytics screenshots (blur sensitive data)

### The Self-Reply Extension
After posting thread, reply to your OWN last tweet with a bonus tip or question. This:
- Extends algorithmic life
- Creates additional engagement data point
- Re-engages people who read to the end

## THREAD OPTIMIZATION

### Repost Strategy
- Pin best thread to profile
- Repost top performers 2-4 weeks later
- Different audiences see content at different times
- Quote-tweet your old thread with a "This aged well:" or "Still relevant:"

### Thread → Long-Form Conversion
Top threads should be expanded into long-form posts (25K chars) or Articles (100K chars):
- Adds depth + triggers "time on content" algorithm signal
- Use tools like Typefully to auto-convert
- Long-form eliminates the 280-char compression issue

---
