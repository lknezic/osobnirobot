## TWEET HOOK TYPES

### Type #1: DATA HOOKS (Specific Numbers)
**Why they work:** Specificity = credibility + curiosity
**Pattern:** [Exact Number] + [Outcome] + [Context/Timeframe]

**Result hooks:**
- "[$ Amount] [result] in [X] days. Here's the breakdown:"
- "Went from [starting point] to [outcome] in [N] months. Full transparency:"
- "[N]% [improvement] after [change]. [N] [things] tested."
- "Lost [$ Amount / N hours / key metric] on this one. Here's what went wrong:"

**Metric hooks:**
- "[Win rate / conversion / growth]% over [N] [attempts / months / campaigns]."
- "Saved [N] hours/week with [one specific change]."
- "Zero [mistakes / complaints / failures] in [N] iterations. Here's my system:"
- "[N]x [improvement] after switching from [old] to [new]."

### Type #2: PROBLEM HOOKS (Pain Points)
**Why they work:** Relatable pain creates instant connection
**Pattern:** [Relatable Problem] → [Promise of solution or shared experience]

**Templates:**
- "Spent [N] hours on [task]. Could've done it in [N] minutes."
- "Ever [do X] and your [system/tool] shows completely different numbers?"
- "[Process] broke your [workflow]. Again."
- "[Boss / client / deadline] asks for [data]. You have no idea where it is."
- "Everyone says [common advice]. I followed it. Here's what actually happened:"

### Type #3: CURIOSITY HOOKS (Open Loops)
**Why they work:** Brain seeks closure on incomplete information
**Pattern:** [Intriguing statement] + [Withheld detail]

**Templates:**
- "One [thing] paid more than my entire [time period]. But came with big risk."
- "I made this for [audience]. [Screenshot]"
- "One rule I never break when [doing X]:"
- "Closed [N] items this week. #3 surprised me."
- "One [feature/method] I ignored for [time]. Cost me [$ Amount] in errors."

### Type #4: QUESTION HOOKS (Engage Immediately)
**Why they work:** Brain automatically tries to answer questions
**Pattern:** [Specific question] about [Their situation or opinion]

**Templates:**
- "What's your [setting/preference] for [activity]? (Comment below)"
- "[Option A] or [Option B]? Why?"
- "How many [things] can you realistically manage?"
- "What's harder: finding [opportunities] or tracking them?"
- "[Choice A] or [Choice B] when [situation]?"

### Type #5: STORY HOOKS (Narrative Opening)
**Why they work:** Stories are how humans process information
**Pattern:** Start in middle of interesting moment

**Templates:**
- "Yesterday morning, [situation]. I had a decision to make..."
- "Three weeks in. Up [amount]. Felt great. Then [setback]."
- "Day [N] of this [project]. Alert hit. [Target] reached. Finger on the [action] button."
- "Opened [tool] Sunday night. [System] broken. [Data] wrong. Again."

### Type #6: CONTRARIAN HOOKS (Against Conventional Wisdom)
**Why they work:** Pattern interrupt + intellectual curiosity
**Pattern:** [Common belief] + [Opposite truth]

**Templates:**
- "Everyone [does X]. I [do opposite]. Here's why:"
- "Most people avoid [thing]. I embrace it. Here's the math:"
- "Stop trying to [common approach]. [Better approach] instead."
- "Everyone chases [popular metric]. I target [alternative]. Results prove it:"
- "Everyone wants more [strategies]. Winners need better [systems]:"

Agree or disagree?
```

[N] things I learned [doing X] for [N] months:

1. [Insight]
2. [Insight]
3. [Insight]
4. [Insight]
5. [Insight]

Which one surprised you?

## ALGORITHM & TIMING

### How X/Twitter Algorithm Works (2024-2025)
- **Replies and quote tweets** weigh more than likes
- **Dwell time** (how long people read) matters — longer tweets with line breaks win
- **Images in tweet 1** boost impressions ~2x
- **Threads** get algorithmic boost when engagement is strong on tweet 1
- **Consistency** beats virality — daily posting trains the algorithm

### Optimal Posting Times
- **Weekdays:** 8-10 AM and 5-7 PM (audience timezone)
- **Weekends:** 9-11 AM
- **Threads:** Mornings perform best (people have time to read)
- **Engagement tweets:** Evenings (people browsing casually)

### Frequency Guidelines
- **Minimum:** 1 tweet/day (consistency signal)
- **Sweet spot:** 3-5 tweets/day + 10-20 replies
- **Threads:** 2-3 per week maximum (quality over quantity)
- **Replies to others:** This is where real growth happens — aim for 10+ quality replies daily

### Reply Strategy (Growth Hack)
Replying to larger accounts in your niche is the fastest organic growth strategy:
- Find 5-10 accounts with 10x+ your following in the same niche
- Turn on notifications for their posts
- Be among the first to reply with genuine value
- Add data, personal experience, or a different angle — never "great post!"
- Consistent quality replies get noticed by their audience

## HOOKS TO AVOID

❌ **Hype hooks:**
- "INSANE RESULTS! 🚀💰"
- "This PRINTS MONEY!"
- "You WON'T BELIEVE what happened!"

❌ **Guru hooks:**
- "Let me show you how it's done"
- "This is THE ONLY way"
- "I've mastered [X]. Follow for secrets."

❌ **Vague hooks:**
- "Good week"
- "Some things happened"
- "Made progress"

❌ **Promise hooks:**
- "Do this and [result] guaranteed"
- "Never [fail] again with this trick"
- "Secret [method] nobody shares"
