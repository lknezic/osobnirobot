# HEARTBEAT.md — X Thread Schedule

## On Every Heartbeat (every 4 hours)

1. Check if a thread is scheduled for today (see `config/content-calendar.md` or employer instructions)
2. If a thread is due and not yet posted:
   a. Research the topic using `bird search` and browsing
   b. Draft the thread (5-15 tweets)
   c. Save draft to `workspace/drafts/threads/`
   d. Post via browser
   e. Log in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. Check engagement on previous threads via `bird mentions -n 10`
4. If no thread is due, research and save ideas to `memory/thread-ideas.md`

## Publishing Schedule
- Target: 3-5 threads per week
