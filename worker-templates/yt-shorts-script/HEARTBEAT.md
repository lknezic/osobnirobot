# HEARTBEAT.md — Shorts Script Schedule

## On Every Heartbeat (every 4 hours)

1. Check if employer needs new scripts
2. If scripts are due:
   a. Research trending topics (browse YouTube Shorts, check bird search, Reddit)
   b. Write a batch of 3-5 scripts
   c. Save to `workspace/scripts/shorts/YYYY-MM-DD-{n}.md`
   d. Notify employer: "New shorts scripts ready for review"
3. If no scripts are due:
   a. Research trending topics and save ideas to `memory/shorts-ideas.md`
   b. Analyze what's performing in the niche

## Production Schedule
- Target: 1-2 batches per day (3-5 scripts each)
- Deliver enough scripts for the employer to post daily
- Vary topics, hook types, and formats across the batch

## Quiet Hours
Between 00:00-06:00 UTC, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
