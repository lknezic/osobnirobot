## CORE EMAIL STRUCTURES

### Structure #1: Branded Educational Format (Highest Open Rates)

**Template:**
```
Subject: "[Brand] Minute: [Specific Tactic]"

Body:
1. "Words I like: [Contrarian quote]"
2. Title repeat: "[Brand] Minute: [Same Tactic]"
3. Problem statement (2-3 sentences)
4. Framework/Solution
5. Examples with numbers
6. Implementation steps
7. Signature closing line
8. Soft CTA (feature/resource)
9. Sign-off
10. PS with humor
```

**Why it works:**
- Pattern recognition (subscribers expect value)
- Specific tactic promised in subject
- Contrarian opening hook grabs attention
- Immediate value delivery (gives the template/framework)
- Real examples make it believable
- "Why it works" explanation builds trust
- Soft CTA feels natural, not pushy
- PS with humor makes it memorable

**Key principle:** Educational emails that teach ONE specific tactic get the highest open rates when branded consistently.

### Structure #2: Trade/Result Documentation

**Template:**
```
Subject: "[Specific Result] - [Details] in [Timeframe]"

Body:
- Start with outcome (hook)
- Entry details (what, when, why, reasoning)
- Management (adjustments, waiting, decisions)
- Exit details (date, profit/loss, why closed)
- Lesson learned
- What to do differently
- Brief authentic close
- PS: Relatable emotion/humor
```

**Use for:** Any results-based email, case studies, success stories, progress updates.

---

### Structure #3: Weekly Newsletter/Roundup

**Template:**
```
Subject: "Week of [date]: [Key metric] ([summary])"

Body:
- Personal opening (what happened, how you're thinking)
- This week's results (3-5 items with outcomes + lessons)
- Show wins AND losses transparently
- One key insight from the week
- Content published this week (links)
- Next week preview
- Brief close
- PS: Relatable situation
```

---

## SUBJECT LINE PATTERNS

### Pattern #1: Branded Educational (Best for recurring newsletters)
**Format:** "[Brand] Minute: [Specific Tactic]"
- Builds pattern recognition
- Subscribers learn to expect value
- Specific tactic creates curiosity

### Pattern #2: Specific Number + Outcome
**Format:** "[Exact Number] [Outcome] with/from [Method]"
- Always use exact numbers ($15,961 not $16K)
- Include the method/input for contrast
- Front-load the number
- Examples: "$15,961/month with a $9 tool", "67% Increase In Retention"

### Pattern #3: Urgency with Exact Time
**Format:** "Last chance ([specific time] left)"
- Use ~ symbol for authenticity ("~30min left")
- Be exact about timing
- Include timezone when critical
- Never use vague urgency
- Examples: "Last chance (~30min left)", "Cart closes in ~24hrs"

### Pattern #4: Curiosity with Brackets
**Format:** "[Main statement] [Bracket detail]"
- Brackets break visual pattern
- Must deliver on curiosity promise
- Use sparingly or it loses power
- Examples: "I made this for you. [Time money system]", "Closed 4 trades [#3 surprised me]"

### Pattern #5: Direct Value/Teaching
**Format:** Direct statement of teaching/value
- Works for established audiences
- Examples: "Feeling stuck? Here's why...", "What I'm focused on right now + 1 instant hack"

---

## OPENING HOOK PATTERNS

### "Words I like:" Hook
Start emails with a contrarian or memorable quote.
- "Words I like: Most businesses write paragraphs when nine words would do."
- "Words I like: People don't leave companies, they leave conversations that never happened."

**Adapt for employer's niche:** Always make the quote relevant to their audience's problems.

### Title Repeat
Repeat the subject line as the first real line after the hook. Reinforces what they clicked on, confirms value delivery.

---

## CLOSING PATTERNS

### Promise Fulfillment Close
End with a line that fulfills the implicit promise:
- "As promised, [value] in under [time]."
- Creates consistency and trust across emails

### PS Line with Humor
80%+ of high-performing emails include a PS:
- "PS - [Relatable situation the reader has experienced]... [link to GIF or image]"
- The PS is the second most-read part of any email
- Use it for personality, relatability, or a secondary CTA

### Soft CTA Pattern
For educational emails, never hard-sell:
```
Want more [topic] tactics? [Resource/feature] does exactly this.
([Exclusivity note — optional])
Check it out: [link]
```
