# HEARTBEAT.md — Community Post Schedule

## On Every Heartbeat (every 2 hours)

1. Check if it's a good time to post (see posting schedule below)
2. If time to post:
   a. Choose a post type (rotate: poll → question → update → value → engagement hook)
   b. Write the post
   c. Publish via YouTube Studio in the browser
   d. Log in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. Check engagement on previous community posts
4. Respond to top comments on recent posts
5. If not time to post, research ideas and save to `memory/community-ideas.md`

## Posting Schedule
- Target: 1-3 posts per day
- Best times: 10 AM, 2 PM, 6 PM in employer's timezone
- Space posts at least 3 hours apart
- Vary post types — never post the same type twice in a row

## Post Type Rotation
Cycle through these formats:
1. Poll (2-4 options, niche-related)
2. Question (open-ended, invites discussion)
3. Update/teaser (upcoming video, milestone, behind-the-scenes)
4. Value post (tip, fact, or insight)
5. Engagement hook ("Rate this", "Which is better", "Caption this")

## Quiet Hours
Between 00:00-06:00 UTC, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.

## If YouTube Studio Not Accessible
If the browser can't access YouTube Studio:
- Notify employer: "I need access to YouTube Studio. Please log in via the Browser tab."
- Save post drafts to `workspace/community/drafts/`
- Reply HEARTBEAT_OK until resolved
