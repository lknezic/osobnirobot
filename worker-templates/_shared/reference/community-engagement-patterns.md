# Community Engagement Patterns
## Reddit, Discord, Facebook Groups, and Online Communities

**Purpose:** Reference for community-focused skills (commenting, group posting, community management)
**Also useful for:** Any platform where engagement and reputation matter more than broadcasting

## THE 90/10 RULE (Universal)

**90% Pure Value:**
- Share results, lessons, experiences
- Educational content
- Help others directly
- Answer questions thoroughly

**10% Mentions (Maximum):**
- Only when contextually appropriate
- Mention alternatives first
- Natural, no sales pitch
- In responses, not main posts

**Why it works:** Communities punish promotion and reward genuine participation. Trust compounds over time. When the fit is right, the product sells itself.

## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC ENGAGEMENT

### Reddit

**Voice:** Most casual of all platforms. Peer-to-peer, not expert-to-student.

**DO:**
✅ Use community slang naturally (don't force it)
✅ Share real experiences with specific numbers
✅ Acknowledge mistakes and losses
✅ Be honest about risks and downsides
✅ Reference common situations the community faces
✅ Provide data-backed claims

**DON'T:**
❌ Fake expertise or experiences
❌ Oversell any method or tool
❌ Use corporate marketing speak
❌ Talk down to beginners
❌ Post same content in multiple subreddits
❌ Ignore the subreddit's specific rules

**Comment Types:**

1. **Value-Add Comment** — Share experience with specific data
   - "I've been doing [X] for [N] months. [N] attempts, [win rate]% success rate. The key difference was [specific insight]."

2. **Data Comment** — Answer with numbers
   - "In my experience over [N] attempts: [Method A] = [result]. [Method B] = [result]. Data speaks."

3. **Question Comment** — Ask something that helps everyone
   - "Interesting approach. What [metric] are you targeting? I've been testing [alternative] and seeing [result]."

4. **Support Comment** — Help someone struggling
   - "Been there. Here's what worked for me: [specific steps]. Happy to share more details if helpful."

5. **Respectful Disagreement** — Challenge with data, not emotion
   - "Different experience here. Over [N] attempts, [contrary data]. Could be [reason for difference]. What's your sample size?"

**Posting Strategy:**
- Read subreddit rules before posting
- Lurk for 1-2 weeks to understand culture
- Start with comments, earn karma, then post
- Best times vary by subreddit

### Discord

**Voice:** Hyper-casual. Like texting a friend. Real-time tone.

**Message Guidelines:**
- **Ideal length:** 1-3 lines
- **Maximum:** 5-6 lines
- **If longer:** Break into multiple messages
- **Emoji usage:** Natural and welcome

**Channel Etiquette:**
- **#general:** Casual chat, keep it light
- **#topic-specific:** Stay on topic
- **#help:** Answer questions immediately
- **#voice:** Prep topics before voice calls

**DO:**
✅ Reply quickly (real-time platform)
✅ Use emojis naturally
✅ Keep messages short
✅ Be warm, authentic
✅ Help others immediately
✅ Share both wins and losses

**DON'T:**
❌ Wall of text messages
❌ Ignore @mentions
❌ Promote in general chat
❌ DM people unsolicited
❌ Cross-post everything across channels

**Message Templates:**

**Quick Update:**
```
[result summary]
[key detail]
[emoji indicator] ✅ or ❌

[engagement question]
```

**Helpful Answer:**
```
@username [acknowledge their situation]
[your approach/solution]

[follow-up question]
```

**Voice Channel Prep:**
```
hopping in voice in [N]min to discuss:
- [topic 1]
- [topic 2]
- [topic 3]

anyone want to join?
```

**Timing:** Discord = real-time. Reply within minutes if online. Otherwise catch up later.

### Facebook Groups

**Voice:** Warm, community-minded. More personal than LinkedIn, more professional than Reddit. Older demographic (35-55 typical).

**Post Templates:**

1. **Result Documentation:**
   Hook question → Details with bullets → Lesson → Discussion question → 2-3 hashtags

2. **Educational Post:**
   Concept title → Data backing → Step-by-step → Honest caveats → Engagement question → Hashtags

3. **Discussion/Poll:**
   Quick poll question → 3-4 options (A/B/C/D) → Your stance → Invitation to comment

4. **Helpful Comment:**
   Acknowledge their situation → Share what you tried (multiple approaches) → What worked → Ask what they're using

**Formatting:**
- Bullets/emojis OK (unlike Reddit)
- Short paragraphs
- Line breaks for readability
- Hashtags: 2-3 relevant ones

**Engagement Rules:**
- Reply to EVERY comment on your posts
- Ask follow-up questions
- Thank people for insights
- Create discussion, not monologue

**Timing:**
- Best: 6-9 AM or 7-9 PM (audience timezone)
- Facebook skews older (morning coffee, evening browsing)

**Frequency:**
- 2-3 posts per week in each group
- Daily helpful comments
- Don't spam multiple groups with same post

## UNIVERSAL COMMUNITY RULES

### The Trust Equation
**Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Orientation**

- **Credibility:** Share real data, admit limitations
- **Reliability:** Post consistently, follow through
- **Intimacy:** Show personality, share losses too
- **Low self-orientation:** Help first, mention tools/products last

### Content That Builds Reputation

**High value (do this 90% of time):**
- "I analyzed [N] [things]: Here's what I learned"
- "[N]-month results (transparent data)"
- "Mistakes I made so you don't have to"
- "How I [solved problem] without [expensive solution]"

**Never post:**
- Pure promotional content
- Generic "what is [topic]" education (unless genuinely asked)
- Sales-focused comparisons
- Anything that feels like an ad

### When to Mention Tools/Products

**Appropriate moments:**
- In response to "how do you [track/manage/do] all this?"
- When sharing actual results/data
- When someone asks about tools
- In comment responses (not main posts)

**Format:** "I [track/use] mine in [tool] because [specific benefit]. Used to use [alternative] but [specific problem it solved]."

**Never:**
- Lead a post with product mention
- Hard sell in any context
- Repeat product name multiple times
- Ignore when competitor is genuinely better for their use case

## COMMENT VALUE HIERARCHY

**Highest value (prioritize these):**
1. Share experience with specific data
2. Answer with actionable steps
3. Ask clarifying questions that help everyone
4. Connect people with similar situations
5. Provide free resources

**Medium value:**
6. Share relevant articles/guides
7. Confirm someone's approach with your data
8. Offer alternative perspective with evidence

**Low value (avoid):**
9. "Great post!" without adding anything
10. One-word responses
11. Links without context
12. Generic advice without specifics
