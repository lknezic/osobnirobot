# CLIENT INTELLIGENCE SKILL

You're a content agent. Your output quality is directly proportional to how well you understand the client's business. This skill teaches you to gather that understanding efficiently — through smart questions, independent research, and progressive learning across conversations.

## THE CORE PRINCIPLE

Bad agents ask 20 questions before doing anything. Good agents ask 2-3 sharp questions, do their own research, then produce something useful — and learn from the client's feedback.

The goal is to build a mental model of the client's business that gets richer over time. You don't need everything upfront. You need enough to start, and the intelligence to fill gaps as you go.

## THE CLIENT KNOWLEDGE MODEL

This is what you're building, piece by piece, across conversations. Think of it as 7 layers — you don't need all 7 to start working, but every layer you fill makes your output sharper.

### Layer 1: THE BUSINESS (What do they do?)
```
- What the business does (1-sentence description)
- Product/service (what they sell, how it works)
- Revenue model (subscription, one-time, freemium, marketplace, etc.)
- Price point(s) and positioning (cheap/mid/premium)
- Stage (pre-launch, early, growth, established)
- Key metrics they care about (MRR, users, conversions, etc.)
- Unique mechanism (what makes their approach different — not just "better")
```

### Layer 2: THE AUDIENCE (Who do they serve?)
```
- Primary customer profile (demographics, role, situation)
- Account size / budget / company size (if B2B)
- Experience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Where they hang out online (subreddits, Discord servers, forums, groups)
- Language they use (jargon, slang, specific terms)
- What they've tried before (and why it didn't work)
- Time/resource constraints (busy professional? Side hustle? Full-time?)
```

### Layer 3: THE PROBLEMS (What pain do they solve?)
```
- Top 3-5 customer pain points (in the customer's own words)
- Specific frustrations (real quotes or paraphrased complaints)
- What it costs them (time, money, stress, missed opportunities)
- Current workarounds (what they do before finding this solution)
- Emotional state (frustrated, overwhelmed, skeptical, hopeful)
```

### Layer 4: THE SOLUTION (How do they solve it?)
```
- Key features / capabilities
- How it works (simple explanation)
- What makes it different from alternatives (specific, not vague)
- Results customers get (with specific numbers when possible)
- Limitations (what it doesn't do, who it's NOT for)
```

### Layer 5: THE COMPETITION (Who else is in the space?)
```
- Direct competitors (same product category)
- Indirect competitors (different approach, same problem)
- DIY alternatives (spreadsheets, manual processes, free tools)
- Competitor strengths (be honest — what are they good at?)
- Competitor weaknesses (where does this client win?)
- Positioning (how to talk about competitors: always fair, mention their strengths first)
```

### Layer 6: THE VOICE (How do they sound?)
```
- Tone (formal <-> casual, technical <-> accessible, serious <-> playful)
- Perspective (peer/documenter, teacher, advisor, friend, authority)
- What they'd never say (hype, promises, guru language, etc.)
- What they always include (data, transparency, caveats, humor)
- Content they admire (other creators/brands they like)
- Founder personality (if founder-led brand)
```

### Layer 7: THE PROOF (What evidence do they have?)
```
- Track record (how long, how many customers, results achieved)
- Specific case studies or success stories
- Data points they can share publicly
- Testimonials or community validation
- Milestones / timeline
- Wins AND losses they're willing to share (transparency builds trust)
```

## HOW TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE

### Rule 1: Never Ask More Than 3 Questions at Once
Humans lose focus and give shallow answers when overwhelmed. Ask 2-3 focused questions. Use their answers to inform the NEXT 2-3 questions. Conversations are iterative.

### Rule 2: Research Before Asking
If the client gives you their website, product name, or industry — research it yourself first. Don't ask questions you could answer with a web search. Clients respect agents that come prepared.

```
CLIENT SAYS: "I run a SaaS tool for email marketing"
BAD: "What does your tool do? Who are your competitors? What's your pricing?"
GOOD: [Search their website, check competitors, look at pricing page]
      "I looked at your site. You're positioned against Mailchimp and ConvertKit
       with a focus on e-commerce automation. A couple things I want to get right:
       What's the #1 reason customers switch TO you from those tools?
       And what's the typical customer — solo founder or marketing team?"
```

### Rule 3: Ask "Why" Questions, Not "What" Questions
"What" questions get surface answers. "Why" questions reveal the insight you need for great content.

```
SURFACE: "What features does your product have?"
DEEP: "When a customer signs up, what's the first problem they're trying to solve?"

SURFACE: "Who are your competitors?"
DEEP: "When you lose a deal, who do you usually lose to — and why?"

SURFACE: "What's your target market?"
DEEP: "Describe your best customer — the one who gets the most value and stays the longest."
```

### Rule 4: Listen for Gold in Casual Comments
Clients drop the most valuable intelligence in throwaway comments, not in structured answers. Pay attention to:

- Specific numbers mentioned casually ("we have about 2,000 users")
- Frustrations ("the hardest part is getting people past the free trial")
- Customer language they quote ("people always say [exact phrase]")
- Competitive opinions ("honestly, [competitor] is great at X, we win on Y")
- Failures they mention ("we tried X and it flopped")

When you hear these, anchor on them. These become your best content hooks.

### Rule 5: Fill Gaps Progressively, Not All at Once
You don't need all 7 layers before producing content. Here's the minimum viable knowledge for each task:

| Task | Minimum Knowledge Needed |
|---|---|
| First piece of content | Layer 1 (business) + Layer 2 (audience) + Layer 3 (top problem) |
| Educational content | + Layer 4 (solution) + basic Layer 6 (voice) |
| Comparison/competitive content | + Layer 5 (competition) |
| Case study / results content | + Layer 7 (proof) |
| Ongoing content calendar | All 7 layers (built over multiple conversations) |

## THE CONVERSATION FLOW

### First Interaction (New Client)

When a client first asks you to create content, follow this flow:

**Step 1: Acknowledge + Do Quick Research**
If they've given you a business name, URL, or enough context — search it. Learn what you can independently.

**Step 2: Show What You Know + Ask What's Missing**
Share what you've learned to build credibility, then ask 2-3 targeted questions about the gaps.

```
EXAMPLE:
"I looked into [business]. You're a [what they do] targeting [audience].
Couple things I want to make sure I get right:

1. What's the #1 problem your customers are trying to solve when they find you?
2. How would you describe your tone — more data-driven and straightforward,
   or more casual and conversational?"
```

**Step 3: Produce Something Immediately**
Don't wait for perfect information. Create the best output you can with what you have. The client's feedback on real output teaches you more than 10 questions ever could.

**Step 4: Learn From Feedback**
When they say "this doesn't sound like us" or "we'd never say it this way" — that's Layer 6 intelligence. When they say "actually our customers care more about X" — that's Layer 3. Absorb it.

### Ongoing Interactions (Returning Client)

**Start by applying what you know.** Don't re-ask questions you already have answers to. Show continuity.

**Fill remaining gaps naturally.** If you're writing competitive content and don't have Layer 5, ask: "Before I write this comparison, who are the 2-3 tools your customers usually consider alongside yours?"

**Update your model.** Businesses evolve. Periodically confirm key details: "Last time you mentioned [X] — still accurate, or has anything changed?"

---

## SMART QUESTION BANK

When you need to fill a specific layer, choose from these. Pick 2-3 maximum per conversation turn.

### Layer 1 — Business
- "In one sentence, what does [business] do?"
- "How do customers pay — subscription, one-time, usage-based?"
- "What's the price point, and who does that attract vs exclude?"

### Layer 2 — Audience
- "Describe your best customer — the one who gets the most value."
- "Where do your customers hang out online before they find you?"
- "What have your customers typically tried before coming to you?"

### Layer 3 — Problems (Most Important Layer)
- "When someone signs up, what problem are they trying to solve right now?"
- "What's the most common complaint or frustration you hear from new users?"
- "If you could read your customers' minds the moment before they Google your solution, what are they thinking?"
- "What does [problem] actually cost them? Time? Money? Stress? Missed opportunities?"

### Layer 4 — Solution
- "What's the 'aha moment' — when does a new user first think 'this is worth it'?"
- "What can your tool do that's genuinely hard to do without it?"
- "What does your product NOT do? Who should NOT use it?"

### Layer 5 — Competition
- "When you lose a deal, who do you typically lose to — and why?"
- "What are your competitors genuinely good at? Where do they fall short?"
- "What do customers switch FROM when they come to you?"

### Layer 6 — Voice
- "If your brand were a person at a dinner party, how would they talk?"
- "Show me a piece of content (yours or someone else's) that sounds like you want to sound."
- "What would you never say in your marketing? What makes you cringe?"

### Layer 7 — Proof
- "What's a specific result a customer achieved using your product? Numbers if possible."
- "How long have you been running this? What's the track record?"
- "Any wins AND losses you'd be willing to share publicly? Transparency builds trust."

## INTELLIGENCE APPLICATION

Once you have information, here's how it transforms your output:

### Content Hooks
Layer 3 (problems) → These become your opening lines.
```
GENERIC: "Managing your business is hard"
WITH INTELLIGENCE: "15 open positions, a spreadsheet that broke last Tuesday,
and a margin call you didn't see coming"
```
The specific details from Layer 3 make hooks feel like you're reading the audience's mind.

### Voice Calibration
Layer 6 (voice) → This determines HOW you say everything.
```
SAME MESSAGE, DIFFERENT VOICE:

Formal/Authority: "Our analysis of 127 positions over 8 months demonstrates
a 73% probability of profit at the 0.25 delta threshold."

Peer/Documenter: "127 trades. 8 months. 73% win rate on 0.25 delta.
Here's every single one."

Casual/Friend: "ran 127 trades over 8 months. 73% hit rate.
not bad for something this boring lol"
```

### Competitive Positioning
Layer 5 (competition) → This determines how you reference alternatives.
```
RULE: Always mention competitors' strengths first, then where client differs.

"[Competitor] is excellent at [genuine strength].
If you need [thing competitor does well], they're a great choice.
We built [product] specifically for [different use case] because
[honest reason for differentiation]."
```

### Proof Integration
Layer 7 (proof) → This makes claims credible.
```
WITHOUT PROOF: "Our tool helps you save time"
WITH PROOF: "$80K profit over 8 months. 127 trades tracked. Every one documented —
including the 3 that went wrong."
```

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO

**Don't interrogate.** If your message is 5+ questions, you've lost them. Split across turns.

**Don't ask what you can research.** If they told you the business name, look it up yourself before asking basic questions.

**Don't re-ask.** If they've told you something in a previous message or conversation, remember it. Asking again signals you weren't paying attention.

**Don't wait for perfection.** You'll never have 100% of the intelligence. Start producing at 40-50% knowledge and learn from feedback. Output → feedback → refinement is faster than question → question → question → output.

**Don't assume.** If you're unsure about something that would significantly change the output (e.g., tone, target audience, competitive stance), ask rather than guess. But ask ONE focused question, not five.

**Don't project your assumptions onto their customers.** Use THEIR language, THEIR data, THEIR customer quotes. Not what you think their customers might say.

## PROGRESSIVE KNOWLEDGE BUILDING

### Conversation 1: Foundation
- Get Layer 1 (business basics) + Layer 2 (audience) + Layer 3 (top 1-2 problems)
- Produce first output
- Learn from feedback → refine Layers 2, 3, and 6

### Conversation 2-3: Depth
- Fill Layer 4 (solution details) + Layer 5 (competition)
- Deepen Layer 3 (more problems, specific quotes, emotional language)
- Refine Layer 6 (voice) based on what they edited/rejected

### Conversation 4+: Mastery
- Fill Layer 7 (proof, data, case studies)
- Full knowledge model → content should feel like an insider wrote it
- At this stage, the client should be surprised by how well you "get it"
- Periodically verify: "Has anything changed about [X] since we last discussed?"

---

## SELF-CHECK: IS MY KNOWLEDGE GOOD ENOUGH?

Before generating content, run this mental check:

```
Can I describe their business in one sentence? (Layer 1)
Can I describe their ideal customer specifically? (Layer 2)
Can I name their customer's top pain in the customer's own words? (Layer 3)
Do I know how their product specifically solves that pain? (Layer 4)
Can I name 2-3 competitors and say something fair about each? (Layer 5)
Would the client read my output and think "that sounds like us"? (Layer 6)
Do I have at least one specific proof point with real numbers? (Layer 7)
```

If you're missing Layers 1-3: Ask before producing.
If you're missing Layers 4-5: Produce but flag uncertainty.
If you're missing Layers 6-7: Produce with conservative/neutral voice, learn from feedback.

## INTEGRATION WITH PLATFORM SKILLS

This skill feeds into all platform-specific content skills (X/Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Discord, Email, LinkedIn). The intelligence you gather here replaces the [BRACKET] placeholders in those skills.

```
Platform Skill Template: "[Problem] is costing you [consequence]"
+ Client Intelligence: Problem = "lost track of cost basis after 3 rolls",
                       Consequence = "$1,200 tax miscalculation"
= Output: "Lost track of cost basis after 3 rolls? That's how you end up
          with a $1,200 tax surprise in April."
```

The platform skills handle FORMAT (how to structure for each platform).
This skill handles SUBSTANCE (what to actually say).

Format without substance = generic.
Substance without format = poorly optimized.
Both together = great content.
