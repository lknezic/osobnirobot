## RETENTION TECHNIQUES

### The Retention Graph
YouTube shows you exactly where viewers drop off. Script for retention:

**Drop-off Point #1: 0-30 seconds (biggest loss)**
- Fix: Strong hook + immediate value promise + credibility
- Never start with "Hey guys, welcome back" — start with the hook

**Drop-off Point #2: Mid-video slump (40-60% mark)**
- Fix: Pattern interrupt — change visual, tone, or pace
- Tease upcoming section: "But the real insight comes in part 3..."
- Mini-hooks between sections: "Now here's where it gets interesting..."

**Drop-off Point #3: Before CTA (last 10%)**
- Fix: Save a surprising insight for the end
- Don't telegraph the end: "Before we wrap up..." kills retention

### Open Loops (Keep Them Watching)
Plant questions early that you answer later:
- "I'll show you why I did [X] in a minute, but first..."
- "There's one thing about this that surprised me. I'll get to it."
- "The result wasn't what I expected — stick around."

### Pattern Interrupts (Every 2-3 Minutes)
Break monotony to reset attention:
- Change camera angle or screen layout
- Switch from talking head to screen share
- Insert B-roll, chart, or screenshot
- Change vocal energy (louder, softer, faster)
- Use text overlays for key points
- "Let me show you something" → visual change

### Script Pacing Rules
- **Vary sentence length.** Short sentences after long ones.
- **Vary energy.** Calm explanation → excited insight → calm again.
- **Signpost sections:** "Part 1: The Setup. Part 2: What Happened. Part 3: The Lesson."
- **Avoid filler:** Cut "um", "so basically", "you know what I mean"
- **Speak conversationally:** Write scripts like you're explaining to a friend, not reading an essay

### B-Roll & Visual Suggestions
Always include visual notes in scripts:
- `[SCREEN: Show dashboard/tool/chart]`
- `[B-ROLL: Typing/working footage]`
- `[TEXT OVERLAY: "Key point in 3-5 words"]`
- `[CHART: Before vs After comparison]`
- `[CUT TO: Different angle]`

Workers should include these cues in every script they write.

## YOUTUBE SHORTS (Quick Reference)

For detailed short-form video patterns, see `reference/short-video-patterns.md`.

**YouTube Shorts key points:**
- 30-60 seconds, vertical 9:16
- Hook in first 3 seconds
- One topic only
- Can reference longer videos: "Full breakdown in the video linked below"
- Same SEO rules apply (title, description, tags)

---

## YOUTUBE SEO OPTIMIZATION

### Title Optimization (60-70 chars)

**Formula:** [Keyword] + [Outcome/Number] + [Context]

**Best Practices:**
- Front-load keywords
- Include numbers
- Use brackets for context: [Real Results] [Guide] [Demo]
- Create curiosity without clickbait

---

### Description (First 150 chars Critical)

**Formula:**
```
Line 1: Hook + what they'll learn
Lines 2-10: Timestamps for sections
Lines 11-15: Links (website, social)
Lines 16-20: Tags/keywords
```

**Example:**
```
Learn how I [achieved result] using [method]. Full breakdown with exact details.

Timestamps:
0:00 - Hook & Overview
0:15 - Setup
1:30 - Why I Did This
4:00 - Management
6:30 - Decision Point
8:00 - Lessons Learned

[Website link]
[Social links]

#keyword1 #keyword2 #keyword3
```

---

### Tags (5-10 relevant)

**Primary (always use):** Core niche keywords
**Secondary (video-specific):** Topic-specific keywords, names, methods

---

### Thumbnail Design

**Elements:**
1. **Text:** 3-5 words MAX
2. **Face (optional):** Emotion matching content
3. **Visual:** Chart, screenshot, or result
4. **Color:** Green (win), Red (loss), Blue (educational)

**Specs:**
- 1280x720 pixels
- JPG or PNG
- Under 2MB
- High contrast (mobile visibility)

---

### First 30 Seconds Structure

```
[00:00-00:05] HOOK — Grab attention with data/problem
[00:05-00:15] VALUE — What they'll learn specifically
[00:15-00:30] CREDIBILITY — Why listen to you (results, experience)
```

This determines if they keep watching.
