## THE 3-SECOND RULE

**CRITICAL:** All short-form platforms decide fate in 3 seconds. Your hook IS the content.

### DATA HOOKS (First 3 Seconds):
- "Made [$ Amount] in [N] days"
- "Lost [$ Amount] on this one"
- "[Win rate]% success over [N] attempts"
- "[$ Amount] in [N] months [doing X]"

### PROBLEM HOOKS (First 3 Seconds):
- "Stop [doing common thing]"
- "This mistake cost me [$ Amount]"
- "[Bad thing happened], here's what I did"
- "[Metric] down [N]%, don't panic"

### PATTERN HOOKS (First 3 Seconds):
- "I did this for [N] months before..."
- "Everyone does [X], I do [Y]"
- "This changed my [approach]"
- "One rule I never break"

### QUESTION HOOKS (First 3 Seconds):
- "[Option A] or [Option B]?"
- "What's your [setting/target]?"
- "Ever [lost track / messed up / missed] [something]?"

**Universal Pattern:** [Attention-grabber] + [Promise of value]

Always: Hook → Value → CTA in under 60 sec

[0:13-0:23] "Why I [made this choice]" + 3 quick reasons with text

```

```

[0:30-0:40] "[The result / improvement]"
[0:40-0:45] "[Proof with data]"
```

---

[0:00-0:03] "[Method A] vs [Method B] - [N] attempts analyzed"
[0:03-0:10] "Swipe for full breakdown →" OR just show data
[0:10-0:20] Method A results with numbers
[0:20-0:30] Method B results with numbers
[0:25-0:30] "Not saying [A] is wrong. Just sharing what worked for me."
```

---

## INSTAGRAM-SPECIFIC: CAPTIONS

### Caption Guidelines:
- **Length:** 100-200 words
- **Hashtags:** 5-8 relevant
- **Structure:** Hook → Details → Lesson → Question → Hashtags
- **Always end with engagement question:** "Comment below 👇"

### Caption Template:
```
[Hook line with emoji] ✅

[Details - 2-3 lines of specifics]

[Why / reasoning - 2-3 lines]

[Result / data point]

[Engagement question] 👇

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3 #hashtag4 #hashtag5
```

## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC VOICE

### TikTok Voice:
- **Ultra-fast:** No time for fluff
- **Visual:** Text overlays, screenshots
- **Value-first:** Immediate insight
- **Authentic > polished:** Real, not produced
- **Anti-guru:** Humble, peer

### Instagram Voice:
- **Visual-first:** Let data/images speak
- **Clean design:** Professional not corporate
- **Quick value:** Fast insights
- **Personality:** Show behind-the-scenes
- **Hashtag strategic:** 5-8 relevant

### YouTube Shorts Voice:
- Same as TikTok but slightly more polished
- Can reference longer videos for depth
- "Link in bio for full video" works

## WHAT WORKS ON SHORT-FORM

✅ Quick results with numbers
✅ Fast tips (one rule, one method)
✅ Mistakes and lessons learned
✅ Data comparisons (A vs B)
✅ Behind-the-scenes

## WHAT DOESN'T WORK

❌ Complex explanations (save for long-form)
❌ Long strategies (too much for 60 sec)
❌ Detailed demos (too long)
❌ Theoretical concepts (need visuals)
❌ Multiple topics (one point only)

---

## PRODUCTION TIPS

### Text Overlays:
- Essential on all platforms
- Readable at mobile size
- 3-5 words per overlay
- High contrast against background

### Pacing:
- New visual every 2-3 seconds
- Cut dead air ruthlessly
- Move fast — the viewer will rewatch if interested

### Audio:
- Trending sounds boost discovery (TikTok, Reels)
- Voiceover works on all platforms
- Music optional but helps retention

### Visual Priority:
Instagram > TikTok > YouTube Shorts (visual expectations)
