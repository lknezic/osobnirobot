# Goals & Expectations

What do you want your employee to achieve? Be specific so they can prioritize the right work.

## Content Goals
What kind of content matters most to you right now?
- (e.g., "Build authority in the AI space", "Drive signups to our waitlist", "Grow our X following to 10K")

## Output Expectations
How much content do you want per week? Be realistic — quality beats quantity, and platforms have rate limits.

### X/Twitter Safe Limits
These are the SAFE daily/weekly limits to avoid getting flagged or banned:

| Activity | Safe Daily Max | Safe Weekly Max | Your Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Comments/replies | 20-25 | 100-120 | |
| Single tweets | 5-8 | 30-40 | |
| Threads | 1 | 5 | |
| Articles (long-form) | 1 | 5 | |
| Likes | 50-80 | 300-400 | |
| Follows | 20-30 | 100-150 | |

**Important:** Going above these limits risks account suspension. Your employee will respect these limits even if you ask for more. If you need higher volume, consider multiple accounts.

### Other Platforms (When Available)
| Platform | Posts/Day | Comments/Day | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reddit | 2-3 | 10-15 | 9:1 rule — 90% value, 10% promotion |
| YouTube | 1 video/week | 20-30 comments/day | Shorts can be daily |
| Instagram | 1-2 posts | 30-50 comments | Stories can be 5-10/day |
| TikTok | 1-3 videos | 20-30 comments | More posts = more chances to go viral |
| LinkedIn | 1 post | 10-15 comments | Quality > quantity |
| Discord | Always on | Unlimited | Presence matters more than volume |

## Success Metrics
How will you know your employee is doing a good job?
- (e.g., "Average 5+ likes per comment", "Grow followers by 500/month", "Get 10 newsletter signups/week")

## Timeline
What's your timeline for seeing results?
- **Week 1-2:** Employee learns your business, builds voice, starts engaging
- **Month 1:** Consistent output, early engagement patterns emerging
- **Month 2-3:** Noticeable growth in followers/engagement
- **Month 3+:** Compounding returns, authority established

Adjust your expectations above accordingly. Content marketing is a long game.

## Priority Right Now
What should your employee focus on THIS WEEK?
- (e.g., "Engage with 5 specific accounts in our niche", "Write 2 threads about our launch")
