2. If an article is due today and not yet written:
   a. Research the topic using `bird search` and browsing relevant sources
   b. Write the article and save draft to `workspace/drafts/`
   c. Publish via the browser
   d. Log it in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. Check engagement on previous articles using `bird mentions -n 10`
4. If no article is due, spend time researching and saving topic ideas to `memory/topic-ideas.md`
