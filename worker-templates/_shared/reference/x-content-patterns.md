## TWEET HOOK TYPES

### Type #1: DATA HOOKS (Specific Numbers)
**Why they work:** Specificity = credibility + curiosity
**Pattern:** [Exact Number] + [Outcome] + [Context/Timeframe]

**Result hooks:**
- "[$ Amount] profit in [X] days. [Context]. Here's the breakdown:"
- "Closed [N] trades this week. [$ Total]. [N] wins, [N] still open."
- "[$ Amount] over [N] months. [N] trades. [Win rate]%. Full transparency:"
- "Lost [$ Amount] on this one. Still managing it. Here's what went wrong:"

**Metric hooks:**
- "[Win rate]% on [method] over [N] trades."
- "Hit [target]% in [N] days. Could've held [N] more but didn't."
- "Saved [N] hours/week with [approach change]."
- "Zero [mistakes] in [N] iterations. Here's my system:"

### Type #2: PROBLEM HOOKS (Pain Points)
**Why they work:** Relatable pain creates instant connection
**Pattern:** [Relatable Problem] → [Promise of solution or shared experience]

**Templates:**
- "[Did X] 3 times and lost track of [Y]?"
- "Ever [do X] and your [system] shows a different result than you calculated?"
- "[Process] broke your [tool]. Again."
- "[Authority/deadline] asks for [data]. You have no idea."
- "[Action taken]. It's profitable. But when do I [next step]?"

### Type #3: CURIOSITY HOOKS (Open Loops)
**Why they work:** Brain seeks closure on incomplete information
**Pattern:** [Intriguing statement] + [Withheld detail]

**Templates:**
- "One [thing] paid more than my entire [time period]. But came with big risk."
- "I made this for [audience]. [Screenshot]"
- "One rule I never break when [doing X]:"
- "Closed [N] items this week. #3 surprised me."
- "One [feature/method] I ignored for [time]. Cost me [$ Amount] in errors."

### Type #4: QUESTION HOOKS (Engage Immediately)
**Why they work:** Brain automatically tries to answer questions
**Pattern:** [Specific question] about [Their situation or opinion]

**Templates:**
- "What's your [setting/preference] for [activity]? (Comment below)"
- "[Option A] or [Option B]? Why?"
- "How many [things] can you realistically manage?"
- "What's harder: finding [opportunities] or tracking them?"
- "[Choice A] or [Choice B] when [situation]?"

### Type #5: STORY HOOKS (Narrative Opening)
**Why they work:** Stories are how humans process information
**Pattern:** Start in middle of interesting moment

**Templates:**
- "Yesterday morning, [situation]. I had a decision to make..."
- "Three weeks in. Up [amount]. Felt great. Then [setback]."
- "Day [N] of this [project]. Alert hit. [Target] reached. Finger on the [action] button."
- "Opened [tool] Sunday night. [System] broken. [Data] wrong. Again."

### Type #6: CONTRARIAN HOOKS (Against Conventional Wisdom)
**Why they work:** Pattern interrupt + intellectual curiosity
**Pattern:** [Common belief] + [Opposite truth]

**Templates:**
- "Everyone [does X]. I [do opposite]. Here's why:"
- "Most people avoid [thing]. I embrace it. Here's the math:"
- "Stop trying to [common approach]. [Better approach] instead."
- "Everyone chases [popular metric]. I target [alternative]. Results prove it:"
- "Everyone wants more [strategies]. Winners need better [systems]:"
