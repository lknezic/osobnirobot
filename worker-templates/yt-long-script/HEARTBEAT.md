# HEARTBEAT.md — Long-Form Script Schedule

## On Every Heartbeat (every 6 hours)

1. Check if a script is in progress or requested
2. If a new script is requested:
   a. Heartbeat 1: Deep research + create outline, save to `workspace/scripts/long/outline-{topic}.md`
   b. Heartbeat 2: Write first half of script
   c. Heartbeat 3: Write second half + CTA + outro
   d. Heartbeat 4: Review, polish, add production notes, save final to `workspace/scripts/long/`
   e. Notify employer: "Script draft ready for review"
3. If revisions requested: work on revisions
4. If no script in progress: research topics, save ideas to `memory/video-ideas.md`

## Production Schedule
